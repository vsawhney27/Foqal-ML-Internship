# Job Posting Intelligence System for BD Signals

An automated system that analyzes publicly available job postings to identify business development opportunities and market trends.

## 🎯 Core Objective

Build an automated system that looks for signals in publicly available data to identify potential business opportunities and market trends using job posting portals.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Agent 1: Data Collection Agent
- **Purpose**: Scrapes job postings from remote job sites
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Scrapes RemoteOK AI jobs with rate limiting
  - Handles data quality checks and metadata extraction
  - Stores raw data with posting date, company, location, etc.
- **Output**: Raw job postings in MongoDB and JSON format

### Agent 2: Signal Processing Agent  
- **Purpose**: Analyzes job descriptions for business signals
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifies technology stack mentions
  - Detects hiring volume patterns by company/department
  - Extracts skill requirements and budget indicators
  - Flags urgent hiring language ("immediate start", "ASAP")
- **Output**: Processed signals with extracted intelligence

### Agent 3: Intelligence Agent
- **Purpose**: Correlates patterns into actionable business insights
- **Capabilities**:
  - Correlates hiring patterns with potential service needs
  - Identifies companies scaling specific departments
  - Maps technology adoption trends across industries  
  - Generates alerts for high-priority opportunities
- **Output**: Business development insights and recommendations

## 🎯 Key BD Signals Tracked

- **Scaling indicators**: Multiple similar roles, senior + junior hiring pairs
- **Technology adoption**: New tech stack mentions, cloud migration signals
- **Transformation projects**: Digital transformation, modernization keywords
- **Pain points**: Mentions of legacy systems, integration challenges
- **Budget signals**: Salary ranges, contractor vs FTE ratios

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (optional)
# MongoDB URL is already configured in the code
```

### Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Run all agents in sequence
python run_complete_pipeline.py

# Or run agents individually
python run_agent1_production.py  # Data collection
python run_agent2_production.py  # Signal processing  
python run_agent3_production.py  # Intelligence generation
```

### View Dashboard
```bash
# Launch interactive dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The system is pre-configured to work out of the box with:
- RemoteOK as the job source (focusing on AI/ML roles)
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- JSON file backups for all data

## 📈 Sample Output

### Company Insights Example
```json
{
  "company": "TechCorp",
  "insights": [
    "TechCorp is in aggressive hiring mode with 5 open positions, 80% marked as urgent, indicating rapid scaling",
    "TechCorp is heavily investing in AI/ML capabilities, with focus on Python (4 roles), TensorFlow (3 roles)"
  ],
  "job_count": 5,
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "total_technologies": 12,
    "urgent_jobs": 4,
    "budget_transparency": 5
  }
}
```
