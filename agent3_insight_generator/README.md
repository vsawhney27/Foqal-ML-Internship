# Agent 3: Business Development Insight Generator

## Overview
Agent 3 is the final component of the multi-agent job scraping and analysis system. It analyzes processed signals from Agent 2 and generates high-level business development insights for competitive intelligence and market analysis.

## Purpose
Takes processed job signals and transforms them into actionable business intelligence insights such as:
- Company expansion patterns
- Technology adoption trends
- Hiring urgency signals
- Competitive landscape analysis

## Architecture

### Input
- **Source**: MongoDB collection `ProcessedJobs` (from Agent 2)
- **Format**: Job postings with extracted signals (technologies, urgent language, budget signals, pain points)

### Output
- **Destination**: MongoDB collection `insights`
- **Files**: JSON outputs in `output/` directory
- **Format**: Company-specific insights with timestamps and metadata

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Load Signals**: Retrieves processed job data from Agent 2
2. **Company Grouping**: Groups jobs by company for analysis
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes hiring patterns, technologies, budgets, and pain points
4. **Insight Generation**: Creates human-readable business insights
5. **Industry Trends**: Aggregates trends across all companies (stretch goal)
6. **Storage**: Saves insights to MongoDB and JSON files

## Key Features

### Company-Specific Insights
- **Hiring Volume Analysis**: Identifies scaling patterns and urgency
- **Technology Focus**: Detects strategic technology investments
- **Role Prioritization**: Analyzes seniority levels and specializations
- **Budget Patterns**: Identifies compensation and equity strategies
- **Modernization Efforts**: Detects technical debt and legacy system updates

### Industry Trends (Stretch Goal)
- **Technology Adoption**: Cross-company technology trends
- **Market Urgency**: Percentage of companies with urgent hiring
- **Common Pain Points**: Industry-wide technical challenges

### Example Insights Generated
```json
{
 "company": "TechCorp",

## File Structure
```
agent3_insight_generator/
 main.py # Main Agent 3 with full MongoDB integration
 test.py # Test script that works without MongoDB
 output/ # Generated insights and trends
 company_insights.json
 industry_trends.json
 README.md # This file
```

## Usage

### With MongoDB (Production)
```bash
python3 main.py
```
**Requirements**: MongoDB connection, Agent 2 must have run successfully

### Testing Mode (No Dependencies)
```bash
python3 test.py
```
**Features**: Works with Agent 2 file output or sample data

## Integration with Pipeline

### Prerequisites
1. **Agent 1**: Must have scraped job postings to MongoDB
2. **Agent 2**: Must have processed signals and stored in `ProcessedJobs` collection

### Pipeline Flow
```
Agent 1 (Scraper) → MongoDB.ScrapedJobs
 ↓
Agent 2 (Processor) → MongoDB.ProcessedJobs 
 ↓
Agent 3 (Insights) → MongoDB.insights + JSON files
```
