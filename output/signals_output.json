TLDR; LaunchBrightly = Github Actions/Circle CI for customer support. And we are currently looking to bring onboard a strong Application Engineer.Â Everyone at LaunchBrightly is a creator, an owner, or perhaps better, a celebration of the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. Most big companies are afraid of entrusting the future of the company and their software to a few makers, and as they defend against that, they end up with three layers of managers and a product designed by a committee. We want the opposite. We need the opposite as we enter virgin territory trying to build that CI/CD pipeline and process for the support organization. As our customer pushes a new feature to production, we automatically update all product images within the help center. This is a thrilling adventure!Our work is remote, not distant. We believe that being a remote-first organization allows us to build an exceptional team composed of makers and sellers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets from around the globe. Our default work culture is asynchronous and emphasizes written communication to prioritize maker time, focus and company productivity. Our goal is not to eliminate face-to-face interaction, but we should default to a setting where written documentation is so strong that a meeting on most project subject matters would seem odd.Â Â Founded in 2022, and backed by prominent venture firms including IA Ventures, Tuesday Capital, and B Capital Group, this is a unique opportunity to join this band of misfits on the ground floor.

Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respondâpreventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safelyâwith the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordinationâso that they can stop a new ignition before it grows.&nbsp; Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

The primary project for this role will be developing software for a fiber optic quench detection system. A quench is an event where a superconducting magnet goes into thermal runaway, and SPARC will incorporate a system using fiber optic cables to detect and mitigate these events. We seek an experienced software engineer (Senior to Principal level) to help develop an algorithm for detecting quenches based on the data received by the fiber optic system. One of the tools used to develop the algorithm is a fiber model written in Python that simulates the expected signals during a quench and nominal operations. The engineer will also help increase the accuracy and performance of the simulation. The development of the fiber model and the quench detection algorithm are informed by experiments, ranging from bench top tests to full sized magnets. The engineer will be responsible for analyzing experimental data from these tests to validate the fiber model and test and develop the quench detection algorithm.\\nWhat you'll do:Rapidly learn and im",
